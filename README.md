# Snake AI - Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a **Snake AI** using **Deep Q-Learning** with PyTorch. The AI learns to play the classic Snake game by optimizing its actions over time, aiming to maximize its score.

## Features

- **Deep Q-Learning**: Uses a neural network to predict the best actions.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays the game in real time as the AI learns.
- **Reward System**: Encourages the AI to eat food and avoid collisions.
- **Training Progress**: Plots scores and average scores during training.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
